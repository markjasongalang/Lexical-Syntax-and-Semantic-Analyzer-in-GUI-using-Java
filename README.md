# Lexical-Syntax-and-Semantic-Analyzer-in-GUI-using-Java
## Quick Info
This project consists of the first three phases of compiling a programming language.  
1. <b>Lexical Analysis</b> - breaking the code into tokens (e.g., <INT, 65>, <PLUS, +>, etc...)  
2. <b>Syntax Analysis</b> - checks if the structure of the code written is correct based on the rules determined  
3. <b>Semantic Analysis</b> - examines the meaning of the code itself (e.g., int value = "hello";, is incorrect because it should only store an integer)  
## Made-up Programming Language (to be used)
The programming language that can be used here is only concocted for educational purposes and the 3 keywords are:  
> <b>var</b> - declares a new variable (note: all variables must be declared first before using them)  
> <b>input</b> - reads a variable from the console  
> <b>output</b> - displays (in the console) the value of the variable or a mathematical expression that was specified
## 3 Main Parts of the Program
<b>Code Editor</b> - this is where you can use the made-up programming language wherein the compiling phases were based upon  
<b>Lexical Analyzer</b> - this is where you can view the tokens that were extracted from the code  
<b>Console</b> - this is where the result of the code (assuming it's correct) is displayed and it is also interactive
